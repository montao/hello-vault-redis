## hello-vault-redis
The purpose of this project is to
- deploy a Vault instance;
- store some credentials; and
- inject them into Redisâ€™ AUTH. 
Users and services now need the password stored in Vault to authenticate to your Redis.)
Vault is a secrets manager that can safely store secrets needed by infrastructure services and applications (e.g. database credentials) and even inject it into other services.

### Usage
Start a vault-dev instance and a redis instance by running ``sample-app/run.sh``
view logs by ``docker-compose logs -f``
The log shoud say ``Success! Data written to: database/rotate-root/my-redis-database``
Run the tests ``sample-app/run-test.sh``


#### Discussion
What matters to me as a software professional are practices and principles such as simplicity, correctness (sometimes simplicity and correctnes are a trade-off), testability, clean code with minimal verifiable self-contained example for demonstration purposes and that the ideas are as easy as possible to explain and communicate. 

#### Practical aspects of the project (the ones that you think best showcase your skills).
Easiest way to run it and test it is by code pipeline with the github action (but that requires gihub actions environment). What the project does and how to run it should be self-explanatory or at least cause minimal misunderstand or confusion with as little effort as possible. The project should be 100% complete, since the last 1% could take 90% of the effort. This time, I found that the permissions in Redis took longer than expected to get right. 


- deployment target: Docker compose. The advantage is the simplicity and that it is available on many systems, and can be run from the CI/CD such as GHA and a local environment. 

- Redis is portable and easy to start. A major drawback is that usernames are not customizable with the Vault Redis plugin. Redis uses a permissions model that is not simple and the documentation and syntax of the ACLs are not good enough. There are several third-party open source plugin implementations, each with different syntax, that can get mixed up and cause errpr.
